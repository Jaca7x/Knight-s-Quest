Knight's Quest: Journey to the Goblin Throne
This game is currently under development.

🚀 Development Progress
The development of the game is going well!
The player movement and animations are working perfectly. The three maps that make up the first stage, "Bastion Castle of Eldur", are already finished — they may undergo minor adjustments or improvements.

In addition, I have started working on the first enemies. One of them is the Black Werewolf, which will soon get a better name. I'm also developing a second type of werewolf that is more aggressive, capable of running and jumping to attack the player.

The stamina bar is nearly finished, with only a few details left to polish. The health bar is also at the same stage, close to completion.
